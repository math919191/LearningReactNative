# LearningReactNative

I am trying to learn react Native. I am working on going through some of the past activies for CS 260 and making them work on React Native. 

Here are the ones I have:
* Cities API -- It's working!
* Todo List -- it's partially working...there are still some things I need to fix



Note... because I am using expo, I have not directly linked this repo to expo, so currently I am copying and pasting code. I will hopefully figure that out soon. But for now, this works (:
